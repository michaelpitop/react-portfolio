      <h2> Originally from Crete, Greece and currently residing in the Greater Metro area of Munich. Newcomer to the industry with a lot of passion and ready to tackle new challenges! I am 32 Jahre old
           and a year ago I've successfully completed
          the programm Full Stack Web Developer from the coding
          bootcamp LeWagon MÃ¼nchen.
          Although new to the field and with very little experience, I have a lot of
          passion for this industry and everything involving it.
          The Corona pandemic was eye-opening for me. Besides the
          immense tragedy the world was facing, on a personal level I
          understood that I was deeply unsatisfied with the carrier path I had
          chosen thus far. That's why ,starting on Jan 2022, I decided to bet
          everything on a carrier change as a web developer, where I can
          challenge my wits and test my mettle on something as fascinating
          as the tech industry.
          As a person I am hard-working. I have a "can do" attitude and
          always try to solve a problem myself first. But, I'm never afraid of
          being asking for help from my peers, learning from my mistakes gives me a lot of motivation.</h2>
